I work for a company called FreeTextbooks, and part of my job is buying back textbooks from people.
If you have textbooks that you're not interested in keeping past this semester, I can buy them back from you for about 20% more than you'd get elsewhere (usually). The whole process takes about 2 minutes and you get paid through our app, which works a lot like venmo.

To purchase textbooks, I can import your schedule into the app and have all of your textbooks ready for you by the first day of class in January, usually for about 20% cheaper than Amazon and other alternatives.
For more info, message or text me (512 788-4225). Thanks!",,status,,2015-11-20 19:05:56,3,0,0

Through readings, discussion, and lessons in fandango (a music/dance tradition from Veracruz, Mexico), this interdisciplinary course aims to progressively deconstruct how we understand music and the role that social institutions have played in our conceptions of music and dance in society.
